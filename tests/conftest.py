Shared fixtures.

These tests run against the real scraped data rather than a synthetic frame.
That is deliberate: the bugs this suite exists to catch (a mirrored column with
the wrong sign, a bracket whose rounds don't resolve, a name that folds to the
empty string) were all invisible on tidy made-up input and only showed up on
the actual corpus.
