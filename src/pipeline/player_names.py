Canonical player names.

Wikipedia spells the same player several ways — different word order
("Kidambi Srikanth" / "Srikanth Kidambi"), optional name parts ("Anthony
Ginting" / "Anthony Sinisuka Ginting"), inconsistent hyphenation and case,
and dropped diacritics. Left alone, each spelling becomes a separate player:
its own Elo, its own form, its own head-to-head record. Parupalli Kashyap's
history was split almost down the middle, and Prannoy's four ways.

This map is deliberately explicit rather than a normalisation rule applied at
runtime. Two real players can have names that normalise to the same string,
and silently merging them is a far worse error than leaving one player split.
Every entry below was checked against three pieces of evidence: same
nationality, plausible career span, and — decisively — whether the two names
ever appear in the same draw or play each other.

Deliberately NOT merged, despite looking alike:

* "Huang Yu" / "Huang Yu-kai" — they played each other in the third round of
  Kaohsiung Masters 2023. Different people.
* "Munawar Mohammed" (India, 2018) / "Mohammed Munawar" (UAE, 2025).
* "Ravi" / "Ravi Ravi" — a single-token name is too ambiguous to merge on.

The Mauritian "Georges Paul" / "Julien Paul" / "Georges Julien Paul" trio read
the same way and were held back until confirmed; they are one player and are
merged below.

Note that sharing a draw is not on its own disqualifying: a player can advance
through a bracket under two spellings when Wikipedia's own page is
inconsistent (Parupalli Kashyap, China Open 2012; Arnaud Merklé, Syed Modi
2023). Only actually meeting is conclusive.

`data_checks.py` reports any new collision that is not covered here, so a
future spelling gets reviewed rather than silently splitting a player again.

# toward diacritics, then the shorter and less capitalised form.

# Vietnamese names are the exception: they are rendered without diacritics
# throughout, matching how BWF and Wikipedia's English pages write them. That
# keeps "Nguyen Tien Minh" (which won on frequency) and "Nguyen Hai Dang"
# (which would otherwise have won its tie on the diacritic rule) consistent
# with each other.
