Design notes
------------
* **No model ever ships.** A point-in-time model exists only to predict its own
  tournament's ~31 matches, so we export what it said, not the estimator.
* **Sharded by access pattern.** The index is small enough to load on first
  paint; tournament, player and matchup files are fetched on demand.
* **Incremental.** Each tournament file carries a fingerprint of the inputs that
  produced it. Unchanged inputs are skipped, so re-running costs almost nothing.
  Because the fingerprint covers the tournament's own rows, a live event
  re-exports automatically as results land - which is what lets the site show
  semi-final predictions once the quarter-finals are in.
