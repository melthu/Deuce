"""
Monte Carlo tournament simulation engine.

Used by the static exporter and runnable as a CLI:

    python3 src/serving/simulate.py --date 2026-02-24 --tier 300 --sims 10000

The engine is vectorised: each bracket round batches every pending match
across all simulations into a single predict_proba call (both slot
directions stacked into one matrix, for order-invariance), which is ~100x
faster than simulating brackets one at a time.

Completed matches of a live/partially-played tournament can be passed in
via `fixed_results` so simulations are conditioned on real outcomes.

    The draw's true round ladder, and how each round's slots are filled.

    A knockout bracket normally halves - round k's winners are round k+1's
    entrants, paired in order - which is what the slot arithmetic in
    `run_monte_carlo` assumes by default. Super 100 and 300 draws break it.
    They open with a preliminary round only part of the field plays, and the
    seeds enter one round later, so 16 opening matches are followed by a
    16-match round of 32 rather than an 8-match round of 16.

    Halving from the opening round then gets the draw wrong twice: it drops a
    round off the ladder, and it deals every direct entrant out of the
    tournament altogether. Vietnam Open 2026 shipped a title race over its 32
    preliminary players with Lee Zii Jia - the highest-ranked man in the draw -
    absent, and a finished Guwahati Masters 2025 conditioned on its own results
    returned the real champion 5% of the time instead of 100%.

    Returns (rounds, plan). `rounds` is the ladder: the rounds Wikipedia has
    published, then halving on from the last of them. `plan[round]` appears
    only where a round is fed by something other than a straight halving, and
    is that round's slot list - each entry ("w", j) for the winner of match j
    of the previous round, or ("p", name) for a player entering here.

    Both draw formats need exactly the same thing from the model - given two
    arrays of player indices, decide who wins in every simulation and roll the
    ratings forward - and differ only in how they choose who meets whom. That
    common half lives here so the knockout ladder and the round robin cannot
    drift apart in how they score a match.

    State is (n_sims, n_players): Elo, EMA form and win streak all carry
    through a draw, because a simulation that has a player winning three
    straight must not keep telling the model they arrived on a losing run.
